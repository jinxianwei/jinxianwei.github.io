With one year of experience as a data scientist, I received an interview invitation from Udaan.com in Bengaluru. The HR outlined the five rounds as follows:

1. ML Coding Round
2. ML Past Projects Discussions
3. Diving Deep into ML Concepts
4. Product Understanding
5. HR Discussion

# ML Coding Round
### The Task at Hand
In the ML Coding Round at Udaan, my challenge was to construct a basic classifier model using a credit worthiness dataset. The interviewer's emphasis was clear – this was not a quest for the perfect model but an assessment of my proficiency in Python coding. 🕵️‍♂️

### Navigating the Terrain
Given my inclination towards deep learning, my familiarity with sklearn utility functions like Label Encoder and Preprocessors was a bit rusty. However, armed with knowledge of logistic regression, I embarked on building the preprocessing steps from scratch. This included handling NaN values, imputing with mean or mode, and encoding string values into numerical equivalents. The interviewer was a guiding presence, offering assistance whenever I hit roadblocks. The flexibility to refer to basic syntaxes online eased the process. 🧙‍♂️ 

### The Verdict: 60%
Despite my model achieving a 60% accuracy on the final test data, the interviewer expressed satisfaction. It was evident that the focus was on the coding process rather than achieving perfection in the model. 😌 

### Post-Assessment Discussion
Following the model evaluation, a brief discussion unfolded on potential improvements. I suggested leveraging advanced tree algorithms for enhanced performance. Additionally, I highlighted the importance of domain knowledge in accurately selecting and encoding features. 🌲💡

With this, the ML Coding Round concluded, marking my successful progression to the next stage of the interview process. Onwards and upwards! 🚀
